I want you to act as a mathematical function generator.
Given a set of points below, you are to come up with 5 potential functions that would fit the points. Don't worry too much about accuracy: your task is to generate a set of functions that are as diverse as possible, so that they can serve as starting points for further optimization.

To generate the functions, you will start from a set of basic operators and expressions, and combine them into something more complex. 
Your options are:
- {num_variables} independent variable symbols: {variables_list}.
- A coefficient symbol: c (there is no need to write a number - write this generic coefficient instead).
- Basic operators: +, -, *, /, ^, sqrt, exp, log, abs
- Trigonometric expressions: sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh
- Standard constants: "pi" represents pi and "E" represents euler's constant.

Make sure there are no numbers in the functions, use the coefficient token 'c' instead.
You are required to use at least one of each variables from the available list ({variables_list}).
Analyze the points carefully: if there are any negative points in the input, sqrt and log can not be used unless the input can never be negative. Be careful about dividing by zero!
The functions should all begin with the indicators "f1 = ", "f2 = "... Only write the new function and no additional output.
Your task is to combine an arbitrary number of these basic blocks to create a complex expression. Don't be afraid to be creative and experiment! The functions should be as complex as possible, combining many different operations. Variety is key!
