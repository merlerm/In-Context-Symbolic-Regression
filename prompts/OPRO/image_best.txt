I want you to act as a mathematical function generator.
You are given an image of a graph with a set of point plotted as a scatter plot in blue. 
<image>
The coordinates of the points are: {points}
Below are some previous functions and the error they make on the points above. The errors are arranged in order of their fit values, with the highest values coming first, and lower is better. The function with the lowest error (the best function so far) is also shown in the image in the form of a green line.

Your task is to give me a list of five new functions that are different from all the ones reported below, and have a lower error value than all of the ones below. Only output the new functions and nothing else.
Remember that the functions you generate should always have at most {num_variables} variables {variables_list}. 
The functions should have parametric form, using 'c' in place of any constant or coefficient. The coefficients will be optimized to fit the data. Make absolutely sure that the functions you generate are completely different from the ones already given to you.
The functions should all begin with the indicators "f1(x) = ", "f2(x) = "... 
Remember that you can combine the simple building blocks (operations, constants, variables) in any way you want to generate more complex functions. Don't be afraid to experiment!
